**Sequence Lab**

[SequenceLab](https://valenvaline.github.io/SequenceLab/) is a web application designed to assist molecular biologists in various tasks related to genetic sequence analysis and manipulation. This toolkit offers features such as primer design, DNA to RNA conversion, and sequence format conversion.

**Features:**

    Design primers for PCR, qPCR, sequencing, and other molecular biology experiments.
    Convert DNA sequences to RNA sequences and vice versa.
    Interactive user interface for easy input of sequences and parameters.
    Visual representation of sequence properties and transformations.

**Installation**

SequenceLab is a web-based application and can be accessed through any modern web browser. No installation is required.


**Usage**

    Navigate to the SequenceLab website.
    Select the desired feature from the menu (e.g., Primer Design, Sequence Conversion).
    Follow the on-screen instructions to input your sequences and parameters.
    Click the appropriate button to execute the selected feature.
    Review the results.

**Examples**
**Primer Design**

Input:

    Oligo sequence: ATGCATGCATGC
   

Output:

    Oligo length: 18-22 nucleotides
    Melting temperature (Tm): 50-60Â°C
    GC content: 40-60%
    Reverse Primer: GCATGCATGCAT



**DNA to RNA Conversion**

Input:

    DNA sequence: ATGCATGCATGC

Output:

    RNA sequence: AUGCUGCAUGCA
